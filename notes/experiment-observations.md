- The marker was all over the place, but for a bit it did seem to work
- hypothesis is that it is related to the number of markers present, since when it did work, there were quite a few
- In the code, I think it should also be coded to be less jumpy, so best to probably add a slight delay after each measurement to prevent jumping
- To test the hypothesis that the marker density caused the issue, I'll set up an experiment with me markers close together and observe the outcome 

### Hypotheses: Marker Density
- Still very jumnpy after 8 Markers within a 80cm x 80cm square


### Calibration 
Less jumpy for single AprilTag, but still jumpy overall 

### Idea: Reduce sampling rate 
The overall motion was correct, but there were large jumps in between those points. Either ignore large jumps or reduce sampling frequecy
